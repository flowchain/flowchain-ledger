Flowchain-ledger is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices (aka. IoT Blockchain). The Flowchain software framework is designed from the ground up to fit current IoT needs.

# Introduction

Flowchain is a software framework for the IoT blockchain to provide a distributed ledger programming framework for peer-to-peer IoT networks and real-time data transactions, and ```flowchain-ledger``` is the Node.js distribution for heterogeneous hardware devices, such as MediaTek LinkIt Smart 7688, Raspberry Pi, laptops, smart phones and etc.

This is a beta release, and it's now ready to be evaluated.

# Features

* Mining-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
* Run on every IoT node
* RPC over the Websocket protocol
* Distributed Hash Table (DHT) by the Chord protocol
* The device server in Web of Things (WoT) architecture

## Documentation
* [See Flowchain Documentation](https://github.com/flowchain/flowchain-ledger/wiki)
